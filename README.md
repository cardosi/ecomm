# Stripe E-Commerce Demo

#### This is a very basic e-commerce app that was built to demostrate a simple Stripe integration.

## Live Demo

### My Approach
When building this app I thought it would be useful to imagine I was building a demo for a perspective Stripe client, so I chose New Balance. Three goals came to mind when I imagined building a demo for a client:
#### 1. Build the App
I wanted to only build the features that would be necessary to demonstrate a Stripe integration. I didn't put any time or effort into things like testing, security, session management, etc. 
1. Integrate Stripe so that a user can complete the payment flow and experience Stripe
1. Add documentation to the app to explain how things work and highlight Stripe's capabilities



### Extending The App
If I wanted to make this a more robust demo, there are a few different directions I could go. 



Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
